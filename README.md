Hi, Iâ€™m @josekleber, programmer since 94.
I started with the good old clipper summer'87, I went through Visual Basic, Delphi, C++ and Java (EJB and a little bit of JSF) 
Calm down, I'm not a museum! 
I also work with Java (Spring), .Net, NodeJs and Python.
I am currently excited about Cloud and the development focused on microservices.
